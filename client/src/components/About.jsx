              Hello, my name is Austine, and I am a Full Stack Web Developer
              based in San Antonio TX.
              <br />
              I have always been captivated by the art of creationâ€”whether
              tangible or digital. The ability to build something functional and
              aesthetically pleasing provides me immense satisfaction.
              <br />
              This drive led me to pivot my career from Research and Development
              to the dynamic world of technology. My primary objective as a Full
              Stack Web Developer is to craft modern web applications designed
              to streamline and enhance everyday life.

            image="/img/profile.jpg"
            alt="profile"
            sx={{ borderRadius: "12px" }}
          />
          <Typography
            variant="body2"
            sx={{
              fontSize: "1rem",
              padding: "30px 0",

              textAlign: "justify",
            }}
          >
            My transition into the technology sector has been a calculated and
            successful endeavor, facilitated through rigorous bootcamp training,
            self-directed learning, and invaluable mentorship. <br /> In
            addition to my technical training, I hold a degree from the
            University of Bremen, Germany, further solidifying my academic and
            professional credentials.
